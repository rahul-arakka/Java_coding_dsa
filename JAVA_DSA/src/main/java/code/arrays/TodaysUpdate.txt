Today we didn't got a chance to work on Java DSA Questions, as busy with a CTS issue whole day.
Just finished the work and sent the mail to Saurabh and team about the whole RCA for Json Exception being increased in the application so far.

Tushaar helped a lot and all these are not possible is he is not there.
He is an excellent Team lead, knows how to handle any situation and people around very well.

We will continue the JAVA DSA & AEM Learning tomorrow.
